# Presencial - Project Analysis

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.23.0 (with toolchain 1.24.5)
- **UI Framework**: Fyne.io v2.6.2 (cross-platform GUI toolkit)
- **Database**: SQLite via GORM ORM
- **Build System**: Task (Taskfile.yml)

### Package Structure
- **main.go**: Simple entry point that initializes and runs the application
- **internal/model**: Data models for the application using GORM
- **internal/program**: Core application logic including UI and database operations
  - **internal/program/theme.go**: Custom UI theme with smaller font size
- **assets/**: Application icons in various formats and sizes

## Application Purpose

This is an attendance tracking application that:
1. Allows users to record their physical presence at a location
2. Tracks progress toward a monthly attendance goal (default: 4 days)
3. Categorizes attendance by area (e.g., CT, CEIC, AG)
4. Provides a monthly report of attendance

## Key Features

- **Attendance Recording**: Simple yes/no interface for recording daily presence
- **Area Selection**: Records which area the user was present in
- **Monthly Goal Tracking**: Visual progress toward monthly attendance goal
- **Persistence**: Stores all records in a local SQLite database
- **Configuration**: Allows customization of goals, areas, and report headers
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Data Import/Export**: Supports importing and exporting data in JSON format
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimizes to system tray for quick access

## Data Model

- **App**: Main application configuration
- **AppLanguage**: UI text in different languages
- **AppInteraction**: Configuration for user interactions
- **AppConfig**: Application settings like default goals
- **PresenceRecord**: Individual attendance records

## Observations

1. **Documentation Consistency**: The README correctly describes the Go implementation
2. **Localization Support**: The app has language support structures but currently only includes Portuguese
3. **Simple Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between models, UI, and business logic
4. **Database Location**: Uses platform-specific paths to store the SQLite database in user directories
5. **No Tests**: No test files were found in the project

## Potential Improvements

1. Enhance documentation with more code comments and examples
2. Add unit and integration tests
3. Implement additional language support
4. Improve error handling in some areas
5. Consider adding data visualization for attendance patterns
6. Add data backup and restore options
