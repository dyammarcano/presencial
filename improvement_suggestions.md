# Improvement Suggestions for Presencial

## Documentation Issues

1. **README Enhancement**: Improve the existing README.md with:
   - Screenshots of the application
   - More detailed build and run instructions
   - Examples of usage scenarios
   - Troubleshooting section

2. **Code Documentation**: Add godoc-style comments to exported functions and types to improve code documentation.

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Some error messages are in Portuguese and hardcoded. Consider:
   - Using the language system for all error messages
   - More descriptive error messages with context
   - Consistent error handling patterns

2. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests:
   - Unit tests for model and business logic
   - UI tests for the Fyne components
   - Integration tests for database operations

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Consider breaking up the large program.go file (902 lines) into smaller, more focused files
   - Extract UI components into separate packages
   - Create a dedicated database package

## Feature Enhancements

1. **Internationalization**:
   - Implement full i18n support using the existing language structures
   - Add English language support
   - Allow language selection in the UI

2. **Data Management**:
   - Enhance export functionality to support additional formats (CSV)
   - Add data backup and restore options
   - Implement data cleanup for old records

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add data visualization (charts, graphs) for attendance patterns
   - Implement calendar view for selecting dates
   - Add dark mode support
   - Improve responsive design for different screen sizes

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add notifications/reminders
   - Implement multi-user support
   - Add categories or tags for different types of attendance
   - Implement reporting for different time periods (weekly, quarterly, yearly)

## Technical Debt

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Go 1.23.0 with toolchain 1.24.5 is used - consider ensuring compatibility with both versions
   - Keep dependencies updated regularly

2. **Build System**:
   - Add more tasks to Taskfile.yml (build, run, package)
   - Add CI/CD configuration

3. **Security**:
   - Implement proper error logging without exposing sensitive information
   - Consider encryption for the SQLite database

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Add indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Consider query optimization for reports

2. **UI Responsiveness**:
   - Ensure long-running operations don't block the UI
   - Implement background processing for database operations
